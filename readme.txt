This plugin allows the user to display Technorati tags instead of the native tags in WordPress 2.3. 

== Description ==
This plugin allows the user to display Technorati tags instead of the native tags in WordPress 2.3. It uses WordPress 2.3's native tagging/taxonomy system. The formatting of the output is the same as of the native tags system: <code>the_techtags('before','separator','after');</code>. This plugin was written to mimic Ultimate Tag Warrior's ability to display Technorati tags.

== Installation ==
1. Unzip or extract the file wp23techtags.php.
2. Upload the file to your plugins folder (wp-content/plugins/)
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Simply paste <code>< ?php the_techtags(); ?></code> to within The Loop to display the Technorati tags.

== Support ==
In case this plugin does not work for you, first check if you are using, or have upgraded to WordPress 2.3, as this plugin requires the new tagging system.
